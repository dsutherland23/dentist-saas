# Landing page screenshots

Place real app screenshots here for the feature showcase. Capture at ~1280px viewport width and save as WebP (e.g. 1200px wide).

| File | App route | Used for |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `dashboard.webp` | `/dashboard` | Hero or Reports & analytics block |
| `calendar.webp` | `/calendar` | Scheduling block |
| `patients.webp` | `/patients` | Patients & records block |
| `insurance-claims.webp` | `/insurance-claims` or `/invoices` | Billing & insurance block |
| `clinical-referrals.webp` | `/clinical-referrals` | Clinical referrals block |
| `reports.webp` | `/reports` | Optional: Reports & team block |

If a file is missing, the landing page shows an icon fallback for that block.
